**DESCRIPTION** - Describe the package in a few paragraphs

The boom or doom radar is a web application designed to break the barrier for understanding the subgenre of cryptocurrency known as memecoins. Right now, memecoins are very popular due to the nature of their value being determined by hype. It is a known phenomenon that many investors have become "memecoin millionaires", capitalizing on a coin's high volatility and investing before a coin pumps. However, the extreme dependence of a coin's value on media popularity can make it very difficult for investors to determine which new coin will give them the best chance at getting returns. This app alleviates this problem by analyzing and visualizing popular memecoins so that users will be able to make informed decisions.
